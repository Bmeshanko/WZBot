To Do with Prime Bot:

1. Optimize Expansion
	- Ensure most efficient play in early turns

2. Add the "Defend" in AttackDefend
	- Don't always attack
	- Sometimes attack with more than needed to capture

3. Fix AttackDefend + Expand Interaction
	- DONE Never Deploy Twice to two spaces
	- DONE Dictionary<Terr, int> saved in OrderManager for Deploys

4. DeployRest
	- Deploy the rest of the armies for future turns
	- Error checking - always deploy the remainder to the frontlines
	- Create Tuple to change attacks made by AttackDefend

5. ManageLeftovers
	- Move armies to the frontlines.
